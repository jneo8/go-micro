// as under the hood each session has its own database socket and error handling.
// Using one main database socket means requests having to wait for that session.
// I.e this approach avoids locking and allows for requests to be processed concurrently. Nice!
// But... it does mean we need to ensure each session is closed on completion. Otherwise
// you'll likely build up loads of dud connections and hit a connection limit. Not Nice!
